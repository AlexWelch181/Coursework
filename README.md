# A-Level Coursework
School/College Multiple Choice Quiz Application

This a piece of coursework I did in college in 2019/2020, it was the first 'project' I worked on. You can see from the code that I was trying to work out how to include OOP in my code without fully understanding it. However, I believe this serves as a good demonstration of how far I have come. 

I would come back to this in the future; however, if I wanted to work on this project again, it would probably be best to start fresh and not be held back by the conventions of how I originally wrote it.
